# Form Editor for Umbraco

Form Editor is a free and open source package for [Umbraco](http://umbraco.com/) 7.3+ that lets your editors build forms and manage form submissions as just another part of the Umbraco content. It might also just be the easiest form builder you've ever had to integrate with your site.

* Ships with (almost) all HTML5 input types.
* Cross field validation.
* Support for multi-page forms (optional).

* Full support for asynchronous postback, e.g. for AngularJS.
* Easily extendable with custom fields.
* Built-in statistics for form submissions.
* Editors can add texts and images alongside the form fields.
